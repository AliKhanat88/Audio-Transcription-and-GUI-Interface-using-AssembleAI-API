- Developed a project that harnesses the power of the AssembleAI API to transcribe audio files automatically.
- Designed and implemented a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for seamless interaction with the transcription service.
- The GUI allows users to upload audio files, initiate the transcription process, and specify the desired output format.
- Integrated the AssembleAI API to send audio data for transcription and receive accurate text transcriptions in real-time.
- The transcribed text is saved into new text files (TXT) for easy access and further analysis.
- This project simplifies the audio transcription process, streamlining the conversion of spoken content into written text.
